This script converts the [[https://www.suunto.com/suunto-app/suunto-app/][suunto android app]] track data to gpx or geojson files


A suunto sports watch can record track data, but the suunto app does not have a share or export function to create gpx files from that data.

UPDATE:
- the Suunto App now has the possibility to save GPX data from a track, so this script may be obsolete now
- Steps:
  1. record your activity as usual
  2. open activity in suunto app, choose the 3-dot menu, then 'Save route' 
  3. Give route a name and click Save
  4. Close the activity and go to the routes
  5. Find the saved route and click the share icon
  6. Share the link to your browser.
  7. A GPX file will be saved
  
This script takes a zip file from the android app, typically stored at =<Internal Storage>/Android/data/com.stt.suunto/files/smlzip/= and converts the samples taken by the watch and stored in JSON files to a GPX file.

To get the zip-files from the android device to a machine that runs python I use [[https://syncthing.net][syncthing]] but any other file transfer tool would do just fine.


Alternative methods to reach the same result:

- export the activity from the suunto app as 'garmin fit' file from the menu and use [[https://gpsbabel.org][gpsbabel]] to convert to a gpx file. This method is possibly simpler to use, but harder to automate as the fit files need to be generated manually each time after an activity.
